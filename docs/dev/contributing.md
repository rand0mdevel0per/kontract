# Contributing

## Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from main
2. Make changes with focused commits
3. Run lint, typecheck, and tests
4. Open a pull request

## Local Development Loop

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
```

## Quality Bar

- All tests must pass
- Coverage must remain above the configured thresholds
- No new TypeScript or ESLint errors

## Commit Guidelines

- Use imperative, concise messages
- Keep commits scoped to a single concern

## Reporting Issues

Provide:

- Reproduction steps
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Logs or stack traces when available
